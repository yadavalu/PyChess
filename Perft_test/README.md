# Perft test
## To test
To do testing, do the following changes in `Perft_test/test.py`:

```
25   #############
26   DEPTH = 3
27   POS = pos5
28   #############
```
Then, to run the program, execute `test.py`:
```
python3 test.py
```
Once the program is over, find the line with the node results in:
```
Depth n=__, No of Nodes nodes=______
```
and enter it in the respective markdown files under the section `PyChess results`.
