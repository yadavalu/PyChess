# Perft test
## To test
To do testing, do the following changes in `Perft_test/test.py`:

```
29   #############
30   DEPTH = 3
31   POS = pos5
32   #############
```
Then, to run the program, execute `Perft_test/test.py` from `..`, or simply:
```
python3 ../Perft_test/test.py
```
Once the program is over, find the line with the node results in:
```
Depth n=__, No of Nodes nodes=______
```
and enter it in the respective markdown files under the section `PyChess results`.
